 - Make sure you have good hardware. Don't be surprised if the touch screen only works well with a stylus. So prepare for this possibility.
 - I highly suggest you consider _how_ you store images in the first place. You'll have to understand what one of the following formats are
   - Bitmap (BMP)
   - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
 - (Recommended) Another simpler option is to create your own format and move it to the computer where you have access to real libraries (in python/java) that allow you easily take your own format and convert it to any standard format of your choosing.
 - Internal storage is limited, you will need SD card storage or use memory (RAM) as a conduit until it is saved to the computer directly via Serial I/O.
